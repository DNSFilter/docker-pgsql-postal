# docker-pgsql-postal
A poorly written Dockerfile[^1] for adding @pramsey's [pgsql-postal](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-postal) Postgres bindings for the brilliant [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) on top of Docker's official Postgres 9.5.

*Warning:* This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS. Don't use me.


[^1]: And one day perhaps a poorly implemented DockerHub Image. But lets wait until this is actually usable and in at least one production workflow first. Let's not get ahead of our selves.
