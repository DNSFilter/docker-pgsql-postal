# docker-pgsql-postal
A poorly written Dockerfile for adding @pramsey's [pgsql-postal](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-postal) Postgres bindings for the brilliant [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) on top of Docker's official Postgres 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 beta..

*Warning:* This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS. Don't use me.
